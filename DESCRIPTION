Description: Every day, more and more data is created. Journalists, analysts, and data visualizers turn that data into stories and insights.
    But before you can make use of any data, you need to know if it’s reliable. Is it weird? Is it clean? Can I use it to write or make a viz?
    This used to be a long manual process, using valuable time and introducing the possibility for human error. People can’t always spot every mistake every time, no matter how hard they try.
    Data proofer is built to automate this process of checking a dataset for errors or potential mistakes.
